## PX4_FLOW CAM

We used PX4_flow camera which gives the velocity of quadcopter and the depth w.r.t. quadcopter . 

To install the camera `git clone https://github.com/cvg/px-ros-pkg.git` in the catkin_ws/src folder.


## Working with Firmware
> Next we wanted to compare the real pixhawk's data with our code's published data.

* Update the Firmware
* Check the port using `ls /dev/px4/ttyAMm` and then change to appropriate port inside the px4.launch file
* Launch locate `roscd mavors px4.launch`
* Here you can see the required rostopic 

## AHRS CODE

We finally wrote AHRE code in which the accelerometer , gyroscope and magnetometer's data was fused together to give a reliable ,fast and less unerring data .

Download the code `imusf.cpp`

In your offboard node paste the imusf.cpp and make required changes in the CMakeLists.txt and package.xml . See our offboard node inside this repository . OR download the whole offboard packege.

Now `catkin_make` and then source it.

Now run `rosrun offboard imusf` 

You can compare the published data from imusf and the rostopic /imu/data

#### Working of imusf code

From our magnetometer's , accelerometer's and gyroscope's data we calculated the orientation of our quadcopter without using the imu's data . We could then use this quaternion and euler angles calculated from here.

## Kalman code

We wrote the kalman code which basically fuse the data which we are receiving from the sensors and our predicted value to give  optimized value.

There are basically tw0 step involved:-
1.Prediction step.
2.Update step.
The basic logic behind this algorithm is that we used a recursive loop to calculate the value itratevly.

# Prediction Step:-
In this we use the final result that we got from previous step and use Newton Laws to get the predicted value for  the next value.

# Update Step:-
In this setup we use our data from prediction step and fused it with sensors data using kalman equation.
